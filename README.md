Augmented Storytelling

Hello! 

Download the APK on to your Android. Open and view the scanned copy of the physical book through the App to experience the magic moment!

we are developing content and magical interfaces between the physical world and the virtual. In this venture we have explored how books in the digital age can be made more immersive by literally "leaping out of the pages" animations and audio. We shall merge the playful and the substantial & real and the virtual to make the world mighty interesting!

Feel free to leave below any comments!
